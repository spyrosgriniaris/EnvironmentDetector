Desk,A desk or bureau is a piece of furniture with a flat table-style work surface used in a school office home or the like for academic professional or domestic activities such as reading writing or using equipment such as a computer. Desks often have one or more drawers compartments or pigeonholes to store items such as office supplies and papers. Desks are usually made of wood or metal although materials such as glass are sometimes seen. Some desks have the form of a table although usually only one side of a desk is suitable to sit at (there are some exceptions such as a partners desk) unlike most usual tables. Some desks do not have the form of a table for instance an armoire desk is a desk built within a large wardrobe-like cabinet and a portable desk is light enough to be placed on a person's lap
Computer monitor,A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial form. A monitor usually comprises the display device circuitry casing and power supply.The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting.Older monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT). Monitors are connected to the computer via VGA - Digital Visual Interface (DVI) - HDMI DisplayPort Thunderbolt - low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) or other proprietary connectors and signals. Originally computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment.From the 1980s onwards computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment  while televisions have implemented some computer functionality.The common aspect ratio of televisions and computer monitor has changed from 4:3 to 16:10 to 16:09. Modern computer monitors are easily interchangeable with conventional television sets.However, as computer monitors do not necessarily include components such as a television tuner and speakers it may not be possible to use a computer monitor as a television without external components.

Mobile Phone,A mobile phone - cell phone - or hand phone sometimes shortened to simply mobile - cell or just phone is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture and therefore mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones in North America.In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services such as text messaging - MMS - email - Internet access short-range wireless communications (infrared - Bluetooth) business applications - video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as feature phones mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.

Electronic device,Electrical equipment includes any machine powered by electricity. It usually consists of an enclosure a variety of electrical componentsand often a power switch. Examples of these include:1)Major appliance 2)Microcontroller 3)Small appliances
Paper,Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp derived from wood rags or grasses and drying them into flexible sheets. It is a versatile material with many uses including writing-printing-packaging-cleaning-decorating  and a number of industrial and construction processes. Papers are essential in legal or non-legal documentation. The pulp papermaking process is said to have been developed in China during the early 2nd century CEpossibly as early as the year 105 CE by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun although the earliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BCE in China. The modern pulp and paper industry is global with China leading its production and the United States right behind it.
Room,In a building a room is any space enclosed within four walls to which entry is possible only by a door that connects it either to a passageway-to another room-or to the outdoorsthat is large enough for several persons to move about and whose sizefixtures furnishings and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it.
Display device,A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people).When the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an electronic display.
Chair,One of the basic pieces of furniture a chair is a type of seat. Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material attached as back and seat to one another at a 90° or slightly greater angle with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades). The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90° or lesser angle.Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms-dining rooms) in schools and offices (with desks)  and in various other workplaceschairs may be made of wood-metal-or synthetic materials and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics.
Glasses,Glasses also known as eyeglasses or spectacles are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. lasses are typically used for vision correction such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness.Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sportssuch as squash.Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neckto prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking. Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylightand may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; Photochromatic glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions but turn into sunglasses when in they come in contact with Ultraviolet light. Most over the counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however special prescription sunglasses can be made.Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information  for example 3D glasses for 3D films (stereoscopy). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction a wide range of fashions are available using plastic - metal - wire and other materials.People are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 wearing corrective lenses.
Curtain,A curtain (sometimes known as a drape mainly in the United States) is a piece of cloth intended to block or obscure light or drafts or (in the case of a shower curtain) water. A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theater that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop. Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light for instance at night to aid sleeping or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside often for privacy reasons). In this application  they are also known as "draperies". Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portieres. Curtains come in a variety of shapes-materials-sizes-colors and patterns. They often have their own sections within department storeswhile some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains.
Mobile phone case,Cases which are designed to attach to support  or otherwise hold a smartphone are popular accessories. Case measures are based on the display inches (e.g. 5 inch display). Holsters are commonly used alone for devices that include rubberized padding and/or are made of plastic and without exposed rigid corners. Heavy duty cases are designed to protect from drops and scratches. A Standing case keeps the device standing upright. Folio cases are a combination of a case and stand and may include a keyboard (USB for OTG smartphones or Bluetooth keyboard). Skins and design covers can serve for protection and personalization. These are the result of the relatively "naked" designs produced by manufacturers such as Apple where the metal and glass components of the device are exposed and vulnerable to damage. They are distinct from holsters, in allowing use of the device while in the case, but in many instances include a belt clip or other device giving it the functionality of a holster. They are made of hard plastic-rubber-silicone-leather  adhesive-backed vinyl pieces. Vinyl material may be calendared or cast ith the latter being more expensive. Calendered vinyl is expected to only be used for short-mid duration (10 years) while cast vinyl is used on a more long-term basis. Calendered vinyl also tends to shrink in the heat and can be shaped into any form (above 80 degrees Celsius) and may fade in direct sunlight.
Desktop computer,A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location on or near a desk or table due to its size and power requirements. The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit (CPU)-memory-bus and other electronic components) disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives-optical disk drives and in early models a floppy disk drive); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a computer monitor-speakers and often a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath-beside-or on top of a desk.
Stairs,A stairway- staircase- stairwell- flight of stairs- or simply stairs- is a construction designed to bridge a large vertical distance by dividing it into smaller vertical distances called steps. Stairs may be straight - round or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles.Special types of stairs include escalators and ladders. Some alternatives to stairs are elevators (lifts in British English) stairlifts and inclined moving walkways as well as stationary inclined sidewalks (pavements in British English).
Television,Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white) or in color and in two or three dimensions and sound.  The term can refer to a television set a television program (TV show)  or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising - entertainment and news. Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s  but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After World War II an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain and television sets became commonplace in homes-businesses and institutions. During the 1950s television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax-VHS tapes-local disks-has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons especially the convenience of remote retrieval the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s  digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV) which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p-1080i and 720p. Since 2010  with the invention of smart television  Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix-Amazon Video-iPlayer and Hulu. Nowadays Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber satellite systems and  since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s  these were transmitted as analog signals but a transition to digital television is expected to be completed worldwide by the late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.
Personal computer hardware,Computer hardware includes the physical -  tangible parts or components of a computer such as the cabinet- central processing unit- monitor- keyboard- computer data storage- graphics card- sound card- speakers and motherboard. By contrast software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is hard  or rigid with respect to changes or modifications; whereas software is soft because it is easy to update or change.
Hardwood,Hardwood is wood from dicot trees. These are usually found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests. In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduousbut in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm trees).
Metal,A metal (from Greek μέταλλον metallon)  is a material that  when freshly prepared - polished or fractured shows a lustrous appearance and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). A metal may be a chemical element such as ironor an alloy such as stainless steel. The history of metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11.000 years ago.
Road,A road is a thoroughfare- route- or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance including a motor vehicle - cart- bicycle or horse. Roads consist of one or two roadways (British English: carriageways) each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges. There is sometimes a bike path. Other names for roads include parkways-each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges. There is sometimes a bike path. Other names for roads include parkways-each with one or more lanes and any associated sidewalks (British English: pavement) and road verges. There is sometimes a bike path. Other names for roads include parkways-avenues-freeways-tollways-interstates-highways or primary-secondary and tertiary local roads.
Vehicle,A vehicles a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons-bicycles-motor vehicles-railed vehicles-watercrafts- amphibious vehicles-aircraft and spacecraft.Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled-tracked-railed or skied.ISO 3833-1977 is the standard also internationally used in legislation for road vehicles types  terms and definitions.
Asphalt,Asphalt is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product and is classed as a pitch. Before the 20th century the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek ?σφαλτος asphaltos. The primary use (70%) of asphalt is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete. Its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs. The terms "asphalt" and "bitumen" are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance.
Sky,The sky (or celestial dome) is everything that lies above the surface of the Earth including the atmosphere and outer space. In the field of astronomy the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the Sun - stars - planets and Moon appear to be travelling.The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations. Usually the term sky is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases such as in discussing the weather the sky refers to only the lower more dense portions of the atmosphere. During daylight the sky appears to be blue because air scatters more blue sunlight than red. At night the sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars.
Black,Black is the darkest color the result of the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color literally a color without hue like white and gray. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness  while white represents light. Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance-good-evil  the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment. Since the Middle Ages black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.
